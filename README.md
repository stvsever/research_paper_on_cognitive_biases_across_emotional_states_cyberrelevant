## 📝 Abstract

Human susceptibility to cognitive biases in cybersecurity contexts is modulated by transient emotional states, yet no unified framework maps the full cross-domain interaction between emotion and bias across cyber-relevant cognitive vulnerabilities. This study presents a comprehensive, preregistered simulation-based investigation combining a hierarchical rapid review taxonomy (200 leaf biases, 11 families, 40 clusters) with LLM-as-judge methodology. An ensemble of **2,629 Emotion-Conditioned Bias Shift Scores (ECBSS)** was obtained across 239 emotions and all bias families using *google/gemini-3-flash-preview*. Emotions were characterized on five factor-analytically grounded affective components (Valence, Arousal, Control, Uncertainty, Social Orientation; **V-A-C-U-S**). Mixed-effects regression identified **arousal** as the dominant amplifier (β=504, p<.001) and **control/coping** as the strongest attenuator (β=−542, p<.001). Six structurally distinct emotion clusters were identified, ranging from Withdrawn/Low-Arousal (mean ECBSS=112) to High-Arousal Positive (mean=582). Affect-and-mood biases were universally amplified (mean ECBSS: 558–843), confirming mood-congruent processing as the most robust emotion-bias interaction. These findings reframe the security discourse from negative affect to *activation level* and *perceived agency*.

## 🔑 Primary Results at a Glance

The two figures below capture the structure of the taxonomy and the core vulnerability map.

*Panel A: Sunburst visualisation of the three-level taxonomy — 200 cognitive biases (outer ring) nested in 40 mechanistic clusters (middle ring) across 11 bias families (inner ring). Segment area reflects bias count per cluster. Panel B: Emotion landscape (UMAP) and cluster profiles — see Figure 2 in the full paper. The taxonomy was constructed through a PRISMA-informed rapid review with GPT-5.4 generative scaffolding.*

*Mean Emotion-Conditioned Bias Shift Score for each of the six emotion clusters (rows) × 11 bias families (columns). Both axes are hierarchically clustered. Red = amplification; blue = attenuation. Asterisks mark cells where the 95% bootstrap CI excludes zero. The High-Arousal Positive cluster shows broad amplification across all families; the Hostile & Defiant cluster uniquely attenuates Social Influence and Trust biases.*

## 📌 Key Findings

- **Arousal dominates**: High-arousal emotional states (fear, panic, excitement) are the strongest amplifier of cognitive bias susceptibility (β=504, p<.001). This reframes the security discourse from negative affect to *activation level*.
- **Control attenuates**: High perceived control/agency (contempt, confidence, defiance) strongly *attenuates* bias susceptibility (β=−542, p<.001) — the largest single protective component-level effect.
- **Positive valence amplifies**: Contrary to intuitive protection accounts, positive emotional states *amplify* bias susceptibility (β=+275, p<.001), consistent with broaden-and-build mechanisms reducing threat vigilance.
- **Hostile/Defiant cluster shows selective attenuation**: Cluster 0 (anger, contempt) attenuates Social Influence (ECBSS=−379) and Trust (−128) biases, while amplifying Affective biases (+843) — a "controlled skepticism" profile.
- **Affect biases universally amplified**: The Affect & Mood family shows ECBSS 559–843 across all clusters — emotionally engaged states by definition amplify affect-heuristic-mediated biases.
- **Valence alone is insufficient**: In stacked OLS comparison, the full five-component model explains 19.2% of total ECBSS variance versus 0.4% for valence alone; across families, mean R² rises from 0.042 to 0.343.

## 🔬 Methodological Notes

### ECBSS Framework
The **Emotion-Conditioned Bias Shift Score (ECBSS)** quantifies how a specific emotional state modulates susceptibility to a cognitive bias family on a scale from −1000 (maximal attenuation) to +1000 (maximal amplification). Scores are obtained via structured zero-temperature LLM prompting with GPT-5.4 generative capabilities via the OpenRouter API, yielding 2,629 scored pairs (239 emotions × 11 bias families).

### V-A-C-U-S Components
Five factor-analytically grounded affective components characterize each emotion:
- **V** (Valence): negative → positive emotional tone
- **A** (Arousal): low activation → high activation
- **C** (Control): low perceived control → high control
- **U** (Uncertainty): certain/expected → uncertain/unexpected
- **S** (Social Orientation): self-focused → other-focused

### Preregistration Deviations
Material deviations from the OSF preregistration are documented in [`src/methodology_deviations.md`](src/methodology_deviations.md). Key deviations: (1) family-level vs. leaf-level scoring; (2) single LLM judge vs. preregistered ensemble of ≥3 models.
